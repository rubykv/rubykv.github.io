								<h3>About</h3>
								<p>I hail from a small town in Kerala, India - Ottapalam. </br></br>

Since school, I have loved writing, trying my hands on long essays, poetry, and short stories.</br></br>

I started my career as a programmer in 2008, working for consultancies and startups.</br></br>

In 2015, I took a break from job and started a digital magazine - Crazy Window. After running the business for nearly two years, I couldnâ€™t make it profitable and had to shut down.</br></br>

Later I took a job assignment in the USA and have since worked in the retail and cable industries, helping their technology department build and scale backend applications.</br></br>

Once again, burdened with repeated and mundane tasks at work, I decided to pursue my passion for writing and building applications as a side hustle. Eventually, this gave me room to feed my creativity and helped me start a solo business.</br></br>

I still take programming jobs that interest me on a contract basis.
</p>

								<p>Apart from our careers, My husband and I love to hike, travel and explore places. We have been to 5 countries and have climbed mountains on three continents on a well-planned budget trip, and we wish to travel the world by adopting a 100% remote work lifestyle.</br></br>

I have an Engineering degree in Information Technology and an executive program certification in Design Thinking & Innovation.</br></br>

Don't hesitate to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruby-k-v-29004a22/" target="_blank">contact me</a> if you need help with copywriting and technical content writing. I would love to discuss the work with you.
