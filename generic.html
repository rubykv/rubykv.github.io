								<h3>About</h3>
								<p>I hail from a small town in Kerala, India - Ottapalam. </br></br>

From my school days, I have loved writing, trying my hands on long essays, poetry, and short stories.</br></br>

I started my career as a programmer in 2008, working for consultancies and startups.</br></br>

In 2015, I took a break from my career and started a digital magazine - Crazy Window. After running the business for close to 2 years I couldn’t make it profitable and had to shut down.</br></br>

Later I took a job assignment in the USA and have since worked in the retail and cable industries, helping their technology department build and scale backend applications.</br></br>

Once again, burdened with repeated and mundane tasks at work, I decided to pursue my passion for writing and building applications as a side hustle. Eventually, this helped me start a digital business by getting paid for my blogs and selling useful digital products.</br></br>

I still take programming jobs on a contract basis and that’s my main source of income.
</p>

								<p>Apart from our careers, My husband and I love to travel and explore places. We have been to 5 countries so far on a well-planned budget trip and we wish to travel the world by adopting a 100% remote work lifestyle.</br></br>

I have a Bachelor of Technology degree in Information Technology and an executive program certification in Design Thinking & Innovation.</br></br>

If you need help with technical content writing or prototyping solutions, please get <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruby-k-v-29004a22/" target="_blank">in touch.</a> I would love to discuss the work with you.
